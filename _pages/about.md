I am Zhenyu Hou, a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University. I am a member of [KEG](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) and am advised by [Prof. Yuxiao Dong](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/yuxiao/) and [Prof. Jie Tang](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/jietang/).

My current research interests are Language Model Agent and Reasoning; Reinforcement Learning; LLM Alignment; Self-Supervised Learning.
