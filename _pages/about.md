I am Zhenyu Hou, a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University. I am a member of [MADSys Lab](https://www.madsys.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) and am advised by Prof. Jie Tang.

My current research focuses on:
- Graph machine learning
- Self-supervised learning
- Recommender systems and robust recommendation
- Large language models, reasoning, and agent systems

GLM Team Experience
======
- Led post-training efforts for GLM models, with a focus on reasoning quality, alignment, and robust real-world behavior.
- Served as lead agent contributor for GLM-4.5, driving agentic capability design and evaluation.
- Contributed to large-scale LLM training and iteration across GLM model generations.

Education
======
- PhD student, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University (September 2021 - present)
- BEng, Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University (September 2017 - July 2021)
